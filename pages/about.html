                        <p>Hi!</p>
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a senior English major at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst! I'm currently
                            pursuing certificates in creative writing and Professional Writing and Technical
                            Communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think that it's quite fair, and sums me up quite well, to say that I am a massive nerd. I
                            have a longstanding passion for reading and writing, and love all things science fiction,
                            fantasy, and musical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been writing creatively since the fourth grade, and am also very fascinated by the
                            technical side of writing. I love to book bind, and have taught myself how to format texts
                            using Word and Adobe InDesign!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also love video games, and hope to write for them one day! In my free time, I have been
                            known to dabble with pixel art and 3D modeling, and even a spot of game development. Who
                            knows, by the time you're reading this there might even be a game or two on this portfolio!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not writing, reading, or noodling around with tech you might find me hiking or
                            spending time with friends gushing over movies or singing along to the latest Broadway hit.
                        </p>
