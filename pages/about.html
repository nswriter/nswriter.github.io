                        <p>Hi!</p>
                        <p>
                        </p>I'm a senior English major at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst! I'm currently
                        pursuing certificates in creative writing and Professional Writing and Technical Communication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a massive nerd, and have a long love for sci-fi, fantasy, and musicals! I have a great
                            interest in writing, and have been writing creatively since the fourth grade! I am also very
                            fascinated by the technical side of writing, and would love to write for video games one
                            day! In my free time, I have been known to dabble with pixel art and 3D modeling, and even a
                            spot of game development. Who knows, by the time you're reading this there might even be a
                            game or two on this portfolio!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not writing, reading, or noodling around with tech you might find me hiking or
                            spending time with friends gushing over movies or singing along to the latest Broadway hit.
                        </p>
