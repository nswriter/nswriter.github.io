                    Above are two short stories that I wrote during a creative writing workshop focused on flash fiction
                    during the fall 2024 semester. They reflect my musings on the changing seasons, and a preparation for
                    the "spooky season". Something about the limitations of flash fiction really spoke to me, and filled
                    me with inspiration; I really enjoyed this exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always enjoyed creative writing, and am always churning through ideas for the next story in
                    my mind. A walk around campus, an overheard conversation on campus, exploring, and especially
                    nature; my senses are always open to possibilities.
