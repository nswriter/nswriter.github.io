                    Oh academic writing. I can't say that writing essays is my passion, but there is something to their
                    authenticity and elegance that I must admit is comforting. And, not to brag too much, but I have
                    always prided myself on my essay writing skills -especially my ability to quickly turn one out at a
                    good quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Above is an essay from a class I took on later British literature. I do not allege that it is the
                    best essay I have ever written, but there is something about it that I quite liked. I love nature
                    very much, and so I guess I can't resist the draw of an essay all about the relationship between its
                    depiction in two works with such rich natural imagery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also included a link to the three articles that I wrote for the Massachusetts Daily Collegian
                    during October 2022. I very much enjoyed writing for the paper, and do somewhat regret not
                    continuing. Alas, time alluded me and here we are, but they are a fond and welcome memory in my
                    writing career, and an homage to the school journalism that helped shape me into the writer, and the
                    person, that I am today.
