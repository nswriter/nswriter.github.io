                    <p>"The Beginner Bookbinder's Guide to Microsoft Word", my first real foray into technical writing.
                        This manual contains around twenty modules. This was a final project for a Professional Writing
                        and Technical Communication class.</p>

                    Since I was young I have always had a somewhat strange fascination with what I would come to know to
                    be technical writing in its many forms. In middle school I often found myself writing documentation
                    or pamphlets for make-believe inventions that I had, and created websites to house them in Microsoft
                    Word using hyperlinks between documents (which is, surprisingly, very authentic to the origins of
                    websites) and writing copy for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I learned about the Professional Writing and Technical Communication Certificate at UMass
                    Amherst, I quickly realized that it could not only be a great way to diversify my writing portfolio
                    and skills, but could be a way to learn more about these methods of writing that have fascinated me.
                    My time in the program has been extremely rewarding. I have enjoyed learning how to build websites
                    from scratch -such as this very page- as well as the best practices for writing clearly and
                    concisely to communicate whatever idea I need to, big or small.
