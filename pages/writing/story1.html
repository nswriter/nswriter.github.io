                <h1>The Tides, or, The Shore Skull</h1>
                
                <hr>



                <p>
                    The Skull sat alone on the shore, unperturbed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was used to its life, sat on a ridge in the sand, surrounded by the hardy, scraggly grass that
                    grows
                    in
                    such places in spite of the wind and the salt-choked marsh below. The tide retreated, and the marsh
                    dried
                    out, the tall reeds swayed, and the fiddler crabs which occupied those grey lands in droves
                    skittered
                    about,
                    re-excavating their homes and posturing at the salt-wind. Soon the tide would return, and sweep bare
                    the
                    land again. The cycle continued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the precipice of fall now, and the breeze wavered between welcome relief and biting cold. The
                    water,
                    which was still a sparkling blue, was soon to be greyed by the clouds that came to roll in. Overhead
                    a
                    great
                    flock of birds flew south to the lands beyond maps where they would over-winter. Inland, the
                    settlers
                    were
                    engaged in a great, last-minute chopping-down of many of the poor, hardy trees that, like the grass,
                    had
                    fought hard to secure their place on these oft-violent shores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the Skull didn't have to worry about that anymore. The rest of the bones that it had once led in
                    tree-chopping, oyster farming, feasting -all manner of hard work and merry making alike- had long
                    since
                    left
                    on the tide, not long after its flesh had been wrested from it on that quick and violent night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was somehow secured against waves and storms like the grass and the trees. It stayed while the
                    birds
                    came
                    and went. It had sunk deeper into the sand, but that was all the change that touched it. It saw the
                    sun
                    rise
                    every morn', set every night. It saw the great white sails of the settler's ships that pulled into
                    the
                    harbor just out of sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Treasure, it thought when it would see them leave, that's what had drawn them here.
                    But now the Skull was content to watch the plovers pluck their way across the waterline, little
                    balls of
                    fluff that dared the sea for its little morsels; treasure of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sun set orangely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It rose red on a high tide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skull watched. It had grown uneasy, watching light creep into the world that morning, sickly
                    red. It
                    was
                    the anniversary of <em>that</em> night, it could tell. It wondered what would happen. Most things
                    that the
                    ocean
                    spit
                    out were reclaimed within a day, a week. The largest driftwood was a rare exception, if it got
                    tossed up
                    high by a storm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skull had been there on this beach for a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That evening the tide retreated from another high, and a man appeared with a small wooden bucket. He
                    walked
                    along the dune, and looked through the marshy water for the large crabs that sometimes shared the
                    space
                    with
                    the fiddlers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The air buzzed, and not only with the sonorous songs of the choir of crickets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The man paused on the ledge of sand, and looked around. Some bubbles rose in a pool next to the
                    Skull, a
                    pool that was oh so deep. The man saw the shadow of a massive crab within it, and with glee
                    slid-shuffled
                    his way down the sandy slope into the divot of the pool. He set down his bucket. He crouched, hands
                    outstretched, ready to shoot into the water and claim his prize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skull couldn't quite see the crabber anymore, but it knew. It could sense him. It could sense
                    <em>It</em>.
                    The man shot his hand into the water, the Skull could hear the splash, the brief <em>“huzzah!”</em>
                    of a
                    catch.
                    Then there was another thrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a plunk as the man dropped the crab into the bucket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skull saw the man start to leave, then yet another thrum called out, stronger this time. The man
                    saw
                    another crab, and started back into the divot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thrum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Skull couldn't look away. It wanted to call out, but couldn't do that either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great darkness rose up out of the pool, and the man didn't see until it was too late. Great
                    shadowy
                    tentacles, which seemed to shift in the orange light, grabbed him. He flailed his arms, then he
                    disappeared
                    from the Skull's view. Then there was a gurgle —then silence.
                </p>
                <p>

                    The sun was red, and a great bank of clouds rolled in. On the horizon there formed a macabre
                    jack-o-lantern
                    grin made of sun and cloud on the edge of the sea. The Skull saw it and was sad.
                    When the sun disappeared below the waves, there was a wet belch from the pool and a skeleton flew
                    into
                    the
                    air and landed on the shore in a forlorn heap. The next morning the tide took it away, and the lone
                    Skull
                    was left behind on its ledge, and would continue to be. It didn't know why it stayed and the others
                    left,
                    why it was alone year after year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the Creature thought it funny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps it thought it was some strange gift, a life on the oh-so-beautiful beach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps <em>It</em> was lonely.
                </p>
