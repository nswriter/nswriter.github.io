                <p>
                    It was a warm evening in that confused state of early-autumn, the leaves only yet goldened by the
                    setting sun, and Price found himself wandering the campus. It was an old campus, dotted with stately
                    halls of red brick and white columns, the footpaths were uneven, the trees growing large and wild in
                    the face of the gardeners' care. It was small, too. Within his first week he had explored almost all
                    of it, and now, by his junior year, he didn't even have to think about where he was walking; he
                    merely thought about his destination and his feet found their way. He knew which bricks poked up out
                    of place, and dodged them innately, and where the grand oak adorned with fairy lights had one branch
                    that dipped down just enough to make him duck. But he didn't know everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Price found himself outside the main ring of academic buildings, on the steps of the lonely and
                    disheveled Krast Hall. His feet had simply come to an abrupt halt, just shy of an upturned brick. It
                    was an old building even by the old campus' standards. Some say it was the first building laid down,
                    though no official records exist of it-they were all burned, it is said, in a spontaneous fire of
                    the filing cabinet variety.
                    He had never been inside Krast before, one of the few such exceptions to his voracious explorations.
                    The bricks of the facade had turned a quite unusually uniform crimson with age, and here and there a
                    sickly, browning ivy clawed up its facade. The lawn was uncharacteristically brittle and brown too.
                    Some nagging curiosity compelled Price to take hold of this odd moment and explore the hall. After
                    all, it didn't suit someone who prided themselves on a comprehensive knowledge of the campus to
                    leave out such a foundational part of it-a keystone of its creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The building, on the inside, was exactly what he might have expected. The old oak floors creaked
                    underfoot, the doors whined on their ancient hinges, and the desks looked like they were ripped out
                    of some one-room schoolhouse of yore. An old musty smell clung to the air, punctuated only by the
                    sour-smelling chalk dust or the draft which pushed through the single-paned windows with a
                    kettle-wheeze.
                    But as Price explored, he felt a chill greater than that evening air would allow. He followed the
                    hall to the end, where there was a staircase, and below that staircase a small alcove, and a little
                    door. As he approached it the door seemed quite closed, but there was a little whistle, and a breeze
                    hit him. With an ever-so-slight click the door creaked open. Price paused, naturally. But some
                    impulse cast aside whatever fear he might have had and opened it the rest of the way. He could smell
                    an even mustier funk now, and saw a narrow, dusty staircase leading into a basement. He looked
                    around, but the building was empty at the hour, and so without a witness he climbed down the
                    creaking steps into a basement he felt he surely shouldn't be in.
                    But it hadn't been locked… So it was fair…
                </p>
                <p>
                    He found a narrow window, open, at the bottom, and a small fan vibrating dangerously on its
                    pedestal, trying in vain to bring life to the stale, flat air that rushed around him and filled his
                    lungs.
                    It was wide, open, empty. Dust-choked cobwebs hung down from the cross beams above him, and he had
                    to duck to avoid what seemed to be a long-forgotten clove of garlic. But then he paused, in the
                    middle of the room, his right foot hovering as if paralyzed. He looked down at the floor. It was
                    covered in finely hewn blocks of stone, laid out in a neat grid, all grey. All grey, that is, save
                    one directly below his hovering sole, which was as red as the bricks outside. It seemed to shimmer
                    with some strange iridescent inner malice, but he knew it must have been a trick of the setting sun
                    streaking through the window.
                    Skreeeek. The basement door whined as if the wind was trying to close it. Price startled, his foot
                    breaking out of its trance and falling upon the stone. He shuddered, and fled. He couldn't shake the
                    feeling that there was something far more sinister than math at rest in that building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Price fell ill that week, or at least that's what he told people. In truth, he couldn't focus. He
                    couldn't sleep. He could hardly eat. All he could do was see the red stone. Every assignment he
                    attempted turned into a senseless diatribe on the red stone. When he finally managed to sleep his
                    dreams were nightmares, and those nightmares were drenched in blood, and always… the red stone. Late
                    the following Monday, when the sun began to creep towards the horizon, Price felt a sharp pull deep
                    within him, a gnarled finger aimed at the bowels of Krast. He followed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the building had all but emptied-he could sense it, he felt-he entered, and went right to the
                    alcove with the basement door. It was open, waiting for him.
                    He descended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fan was still there; it was silent. He grabbed it, and strode towards the red stone. The cord
                    pulled free from the strained extension cord that fed it from above.
                    He stood above the red stone, toed it. Then with a simple, instinctive motion he twirled the fan
                    sideways, and began smashing the base against the stone. The old, frail plastic gave way, revealing
                    a metal core which rang out with each strike. With unnatural strength-his muscles straining,
                    tearing-Price brought the fan down one last time, and the red stone cracked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darkness filled the room, forcing out the musty air, leaving only a void. Dully, Price thought about
                    how the fan had finally achieved its goal, then slumped to the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, something else entered the basement, crawling up from a hole that the red stone had long ago
                    plugged.
