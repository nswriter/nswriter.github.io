                <h2>My Writing Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I began to write creatively in fourth grade, penning a series of stories about dragons on small,
                    yellow legal pages between lessons. From then on, I knew that I wanted to write and be around
                    writing no matter where my journey took me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to think that I go above and beyond when it comes to writing. Any chance I am offered for
                    creative writing I endeavor to turn into an epic project. Over the
                    course of middle school to high school I turned two creative writing projects into novellas, a
                    weekly vocabulary exercise into a serialized story, and even took an independent study to churn out
                    a novel-length project!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, my professional writing journey was quietly beginning. In ninth grade I was
                    recruited to my high school's student newspaper, the <cite>Paw Print</cite>. I thoroughly enjoyed my
                    time in the paper, and all of the challenges that it posed. Soon, I was promoted to an editor
                    position, and later editor-in-chief! During this time, I was tasked with overseeing our transition
                    to an online format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I turned my attention to university and my future, I knew that a degree in English was the only
                    logical pursuit. I had my eyes set on a future in publishing and creative writing, and joined the
                    creative writing certificate program instantly. As time progressed, however, I decided to diversify
                    to broaden my horizons and itch my technical interests, thus begining my journey on the Professional Writing and Technical
                    Communication certificate program. This was certainly a great choice! I have very much enjoyed my
                    time learning all about documentation, writing for the web (and web design itself!) and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to see where my writing career takes me next!
                </p>
